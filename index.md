## Short Bio
I am a PhD student as well as an assistant engineer in ISCAS, pursuing my Ph.D degree under the supervision of Prof. Jian Zhang and Prof. Jun Yan.
My research interest is software analysis and testing, especially on mobile apps. 
My current work focuses on the multiple entry testing of Android apps.
